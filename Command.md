# Command Line Tutorial

What is the Command Line?

* The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. 

Why do you do you use it?

* From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with your Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on MAC OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.
 
How do you use it?

* Here is a tutorial on how to use the Command Line: 

  CD:

	* cd takes a directory name as an argument, and switches into that directory. To navigate directly to a directory, use cd with the direcory's path. 

	Example:
        ![Image of Yaktocat](/CD.png)


  MKDIR:
	* mkdir takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory. Here we use mkdir to create a new directory named media. 

	Example:
	image  

  CP:
	
	*cp copies files or directories. It can be used when you want to copy an image, or files into another location. 
	-Example:
         -image
