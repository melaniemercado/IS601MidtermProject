10) Unit Test:

    A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. Unit testing involves breaking your program into pieces, and subjecting each piece to a series of tests.

11) Constructor: 

    A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class. Python relies on the constructor to perform tasks such as initializing(assigning values to) any instance variables that the object will need when it starts. Constructors can also verify that there are enough resources for the object and perform any other start-up task you can think of.

    The name of a constructor is always the same, __init__(). The constructor can accept arguments when necessary to create the object. When you create a class without a constructor, Python automatically creates a default constructor for you that doesn’t do anything. Every class must have a constructor, even if it simply relies on the default constructor. 

12) Factory:

    Factory Method is a creational design pattern used to create concrete implementations of a common interface. It separates the process of creating an object from the code that depends on the interface of the object.
    
    For example, an application requires an object with a specific interface to perform its tasks. The concrete implementation of the interface is identified by some parameter.
    Instead of using a complex if/elif/else conditional structure to determine the concrete implementation, the application delegates that decision to a separate component that creates the concrete object. With this approach, the application code is simplified, making it more reusable and easier to maintain.

13) Decorator:

    A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

    Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in Python since it allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.

14) Extend Class:

    Inheritance is the mechanism of deriving new classes from existing ones. By doing this we get a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a "child object") acquires all, - though there are exceptions in some programming languages, - of the properties and behaviors of the parent object.

    Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, and this makes it possible that a class created through inheritance inherites the attributes and methods of the parent class. This means that inheritance supports code reusability. The methods or generally speaking the software inherited by a subclass is considered to be reused in the subclass. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed graph.

15) CSV Files:

    CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.
